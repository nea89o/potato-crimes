# Potato Crimes 

A mod for the [24w14potato April Fools Snapshot](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/poisonous-potato-update).

> In this mod, carrots are illegal contraband, and transporting it across dimensions is a crime punishable by death.
> 
> Can you smuggle carrots into the potato dimension, and trade them to the local villagers who want some diversity in their stews and other dishes?

Made in about 3 or so hours for [the 24w14potato ModFest FlashFest](https://modfest.net/).
